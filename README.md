# Backpropagation-for-a-Multi-Layer-Neural-Network
Multi-layer neural network with three hidden layers is made using TensorFlow Keras. In the notebook you will find
Gradient descent  and backpropagation 
algorithm for the neural network.
Training the model on the created dataset using the backpropagation algorithm.
Comparion the model's performance with that of a built-in TensorFlow Keras optimizer.
